Hello! I'm AndrÃ©s Marolt, a passionate Frontend Developer based in Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·. At 28 years old, I've built several web applications with JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, Angular, Node.js, and Express.js. My coding journey has been driven by the desire to create robust and efficient web solutions. While my skills are rooted mainly in frontend technologies, my curiosity often leads me to explore various creative outlets, including playing bass guitar. Let's join forces and leverage technology to make a positive impact in the digital landscape!
